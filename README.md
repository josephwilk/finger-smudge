# Finger Smudge

An art project producing :musical_score: music for :computer: machines. 
Firstly exploring the digital fingerprinting of audio music. As used in sites like YouTube & SoundCloud to detect copyright infringment.

## Notes 

Chromaprint Algorithm:

Chromaprint FFT Image representation

* Y axis (Energy) -> A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#
* X axis (Time) - Is is fixed or dynamic...

#### Steps

1. FFT transform of audio (sampling rate 11025 Hz, frame size is 4096 (0.371 s) with 2/3 overlap.)
2. Frequencies => Musical notes (not octaves). Chroma features.
3. 16x12 pixel window moving across image one pixel at a time
4. Apply 16 filteres that capture intensity dirrerences across musical notes && time.
5. Filters "calculate the sum of specific areas of the grayscale subimage and then compare the two sums."
6. Quantize the real number with 3 coeeficents (learnt).
7. 16 filters and each can produce an integer that can be encoded into 2 bits (using the Gray code), so if you combine all the results, you get a 32-bit integer.
