## Notes 

Chromaprint Algorithm:

1. FFT transform of audio.
2. Frequencies => Musical notes (not octaves). Chroma features.
3. 16x12 pixel window moving across image one pixel at a time
4. Apply 16 filteres that capture intensity dirrerences across musical notes && time.
5. Filters "calculate the sum of specific areas of the grayscale subimage and then compare the two sums."
6. Quantize the real number with 3 coeeficents (learnt).
7. 16 filters and each can produce an integer that can be encoded into 2 bits (using the Gray code), so if you combine all the results, you get a 32-bit integer.
